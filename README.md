# Udacity-Projects
Deep learning nanodegree

Hello! My name is Mario Janakis. I am a student of linguistics and Japanese and I spent the past three years living and teaching in Japan. I first studied computational linguistics in college. I only had one semester of experience with it, but it was such an exciting field to learn about. While I was overseas, I wanted to improve my coding skills and understanding of machine learning even further, so I decided to enroll in a course on Udacity.com for deep learning. It was a very big jump in skill level from what I had experienced before, but I had a blast learning about applications of computational linguistics, and in particular, natural language processing.
Included here are projects that I worked on while I was taking the course.
